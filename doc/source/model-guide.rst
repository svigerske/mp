Modeling guide for MP-based AMPL solvers
=========================================


Ever wondered how to model logical and non-linear constraints? For example:

- At most one of the variables *x*, *y* can be positive

- All variables in a group should have different values

- Piecewise-linear approximation of *y = sin(x)*.

MP automates many of such modeling tasks by reformulating AMPL models
suitably for the given solver.
Moreover, MP supports :ref:`multiple-objectives`.
A series of small modeling tasks like these are handled in the
`MP Modeling Series <https://ampl.com/streamlit/Modeling_Tips>`_,
while below follows a comprehensive guide.
